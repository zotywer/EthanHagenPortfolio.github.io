<h1>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</h1>

<p> This movie is the best movie because of all the massive events that happened. Han and Leia confess, Luke battles Vader, Yoda' training, the astroid feild, etc.</p>

<p> My favorite actor was Frank Oz, because Yoda is awesome. Said 'nuff, there was. </p>
